# Math Game

Since my daughter is having trouble with math, I decided to start building a game to help her. This game is written in [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/)

## Playing

Currently this game is in a simple state. 

* Press `start` to throw some numbers in.
* Type your number in the blank box
* Click enter

You will be told the correct answer if you're wrong, and gain a point if you're right.

## TODO

1. Add in some graphics
2. Add in levels
3. Add in actual game play
4. Add in subtraction

## Other

Feel free to fork, or whatever. If you want to help me out, that would be cool. I am, however, basing the game off my Daughter's skill set. She's in first grade.
